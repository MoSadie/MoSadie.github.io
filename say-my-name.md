Welcome to the hidden page on my site where I gather clips of streamers attempting to say my username.

Usually while they're streaming if they don't know me they pronounce it as "Mo Sad ie" which I find personally funny. (For refernce I pronounce it as "Mo Sadie")

No shame to them of course, they're reading my name blind outloud. It's hard, I've tried.

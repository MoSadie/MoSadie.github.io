### Boarding Group

Since the Rise of the Resistance ride is so new, everyone is trying to ride it. Instead of a many many hour queue, Disney decided to make a virtual queue.
When the park opens, everyone inside the park at that moment can use their phone with the Disneyland app to try to get a boarding group for Rise of the Resistance.
Note: 1 boarding group != 1 family.
On average, around 80 boarding groups will get called. Though it can and has been less. You can check the status in the app and you will get a push notification when you can get in the ride queue.
There also are signs around the park with the currently boarding boarding groups.

At the time of writing this (1/22), boarding groups are all distributed within <1 minute after park opening.
Our best chance would be to go to "rope drop," so we're already in the park when it opens and have everyone try to get boarding groups for everyone.

NOTE: ALL MEMBER OF YOUR PARTY WHO WANT TO JOIN A BOARDING GROUP MUST BE IN THE PARK TO JOIN.

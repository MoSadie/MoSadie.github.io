# Favorite Projects (that I worked on)

- [EffectMC](https://github.com/MoSadie/EffectMC): A Minecraft mod and Elgato Stream Deck plugin that allows special effects to occur in-game with the push of a button.  For example, a user can mimic a text chat, seamlessly join a server, and play any sound. Also supports custom triggers using HTML requests.
- [Berners Love You](https://berners.mosadie.com): Often shortened to `Berners`. During COVID-19, I recognized a social/emotional need and designed a stress-relieving tool for a family member. From this project, I learned how to dynamically embed content from social media.
- [ExponentialPower](https://github.com/MoSadie/ExponentialPower): This Minecraft mod generates energy, through an exponential formula, that can be stored and used by other mods. From this mod, I learned how to interact with third-party APIs.
- [PracticeFMS](https://github.com/MoSadie/PracticeFMS): I designed and created a tool for my [FRC](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) team allowing them to emulate a competition field management system. The team practiced driving the robot in a realistic manner; including connecting the driving computers and realistic match timers.

# Future/Current Projects
- [TWABL;DR](https://twabldr.mosadie.com): I play a lot of the video game [Destiny 2](https://bungie.net) and I write summaries of the weekly development blog post. I used to just post these in my clan's Discord, but using GitHub Pages allows me to add pictures/videos, control more aspects of formatting, and ignore the character limit in Discord.
- [EffectMC](https://github.com/MoSadie/EffectMC): I'm always coming up with more ideas of effects to add.
- [Destiny Sherpa Guide](https://dsg.mosadie.com): Still _very much_ a WIP, but I want to write guides for sherpas for every Destiny 2 Raid, Dungeon, and every other difficult activity.

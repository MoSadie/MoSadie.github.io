# Favorite Projects (that I worked on)

- [EffectMC](https://github.com/MoSadie/EffectMC): A Minecraft mod and Elgato Stream Deck plugin that allows various effects to occur in-game with the push of a button. First time developing a Elgato Stream Deck plugin and I'm proud of the flexability of the communication between the mod and the plugin.
- [Berners Love You](https://berners.mosadie.com): Often shortened to `Berners`, I am proud of this project for the sheer scale of pictures I've collected. At the time of writing there are 1600+ pictures and videos possible to see.
- [ExponentialPower](https://github.com/MoSadie/ExponentialPower): My first Minecraft mod to gain a substantial amount of downloads.
- [PracticeFMS](https://github.com/MoSadie/PracticeFMS): While I no longer maintain this project, I am extremely proud of the background work that went into this project. I made this project as a tool for the [FRC](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) team I was a part of. Combining this with other tools allowed our team to make robot driving practice as realistic as possible, including connecting the driving computers, programming the robot radio, and realistic timings.

# Future/Current Projects
- [TWABL;DR](https://twabldr.mosadie.com): I play a lot of the video game [Destiny 2](https://bungie.net) and I write summaries of the weekly development blog post. I used to just post these in my clan's Discord, but using GitHub Pages allows me to do things like add pictures and videos and ignore the character limit in Discord.
- [EffectMC](https://github.com/MoSadie/EffectMC): I'm always coming up with more ideas of effects to add.
- [Destiny Sherpa Guide](https://dsg.mosadie.com): Still very much a WIP, but I want to write guides for sherpas for every Destiny 2 Raid, Dungeon, and every other difficult activity.
